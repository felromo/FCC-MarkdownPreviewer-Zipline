## Using The Application

### Try it out
There is a github page provided to try out the application without having to pull the repo
http://tyrantwarship.github.io/FCC-MarkdownPreviewer-Zipline/


### How To Run Locally
First you'll need to run `npm install` to install all the dependencies listed in the provided package.json

Then `npm run dev` to run the web application server on port 3000 (you can change this by modifying the listening port on server.js)

Finally fire up a web browser and point it to http://localhost:3000

### How to Build
You can build it with `npm run deploy` and it will create a bundle.js inside of the dist folder containing all the dependencies

Happy Hacking! Pull requests welcome
