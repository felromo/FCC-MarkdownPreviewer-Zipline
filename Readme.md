## How To Build
First you'll need to run `npm install` to install all the dependencies listed in the provided package.json

Then `node server.js` to run the web application server on port 3000 (you can change this by modifying the listening port on server.js)

Finally fire up a web browser and point it to http://localhost:3000

Happy Hacking! Pull requests welcome
